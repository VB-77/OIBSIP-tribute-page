        <p style="font-size: medium;font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">
            Sapkal was born on 14 November 1948,in Pimpri Meghe village in Wardha district in the then Central Provinces and Berar of Dominion of India to Abhimanyu Sathe, a cowherder. Being an unwanted child, she was referred to as Chindhi (Marathi for "piece of rag"). Abject poverty, family responsibilities and an early marriage forced her to quit formal education after she successfully passed the fourth standard. Sapkal was married off at age 12 to Shrihari Sapkal, who was 20 years older than her, and moved to Nawargaon village, Seloo in Wardha. The marriage did not last long and at the age of 20, she was left on her own to care for a girl child.
